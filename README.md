# Night Mind

This theme is my take on my favorite dark themes, with a focus on where focus is. Rich text elements, with a dim UI and bright focus color used to direct attention to actions. (currently pink, but will have options someday.)

Focus elements - Dimmed git highlights, bracket and indent highlights, as well as object highlighting \*(not on all word highlights!)

Highlighting - Active/Inactive

Matching word highlight is subtle, while search highlight stands out

## Customize

Used with BracketPair Colorizor2 extension (theme styles indent lines)

```json
  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.showHorizontalScopeLine": false,
  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.showVerticalScopeLine": false,
  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colorMode": "Independent",
  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": [
    "#7b56ff",
    "#00b1ff",
    "#9cd9ff"
  ],
  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.unmatchedScopeColor": "#f05050"
```

## To Come

Going to revisit some of the git colors for explorer and problem highlights
Other backgrounds / focus colors

### Opinionated Theme

Feedback is welcome but this theme was made for use by my self. Many choices are based on the use of VIM/NeoVim extensions, and other colored extensions. This will be included in a Extension pack, with keybindings/snippets and custom colors/styles to fit the themes in the future.

_Keep in mind you can always set your defaults in settings_
