# Night Mind

This theme is my take on my favorite dark themes, with a focus on where focus is. Rich text elements, with a dim UI and bright focus color used to direct attention to actions. (currently pink, but will have options someday.)

Focus elements - Dimmed git highlights, bracket and indent highlights, as well as object highlighting \*(not on all word highlights!)

Matching word highlight is subtle, while search highlight stands out

  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.showVerticalScopeLine": false,
  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.colors": ["#c4c3f8", "#f8f8c3", "#a8d2f4"],
  "bracket-pair-colorizer-2.unmatchedScopeColor": "#f05050",

```

## Notes

Making alternate color options (next will be simplified textmate colors)
Removed Old Color Layout [old-gray]
Going to revisit some of the git colors for explorer and problem highlights
Still working on getting more languages polished and uniform.
Other backgrounds / focus colors

### Opinionated Theme

Feedback is welcome but this theme was made for use by my self. Many choices are based on the use of VIM/NeoVim extensions, and other colored extensions. This will be included in a Extension pack, with keybindings/snippets and custom colors/styles to fit the themes in the future.

_Keep in mind you can always change your color defaults in settings.json_
