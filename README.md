### Opinionated Theme

Feedback is welcome but this theme was made for use by my self. Many choices are based on the use of VIM/NeoVim extensions, and other colored extensions. This will be included in a Extension pack, with keybindings/snippets and custom colors/styles to fit the themes in the future.
